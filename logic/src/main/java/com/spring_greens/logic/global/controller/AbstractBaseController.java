/**
 * This is abstract class for MapController and MainController. <br>
 * because Let's make one assumption that client want to get redis products so send to server HTTP GET request. <br>
 * then server response it. <br>
 *
 * but we need to consider how to handle common request. ( get product ) <br>
 * currently, client send request to server on map and main page. <br>
 *
 * if we define interface for map and main if so abstract method have to implement each.
 * but, it's way was not good solution. because of only get products to redis server and then convert to specific type response that's it <br>
 * so, I thought that implement a common processing logic by the abstract class. <br>
